      value: '<h2>&nbsp;</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Recognition is more than just saying ‘thank you’—it’s about building a culture where hard work and dedication are acknowledged and valued. Our new program allows employees to nominate peers for their contributions, whether it’s excellent customer service, innovative problem-solving, or simply being a great team player. Every month, we’ll spotlight selected employees in our intranet and reward them with special perks!</em></p><p><em>How does it work? It’s simple! Just head over to the ‘Recognitions’ section in our intranet, submit a short message about why your colleague deserves a shout-out, and we’ll take care of the rest. You can recognize anyone across teams, departments, or offices—because great work happens everywhere!</em></p><p><em>Each month, the most inspiring recognitions will be featured in our newsletter, and winners will receive special perks such as gift cards, an extra day off, or a lunch voucher. It’s a small way to say a big ‘thank you’ for the dedication and effort our team puts in every day.</em></p><p><em>We believe that appreciation should be part of our daily culture. Small gestures of recognition can have a big impact, boosting morale, strengthening team connections, and making NextCorp an even better place to work. So, take a moment to recognize someone today—it only takes a minute, but it makes a world of difference!</em></p><p><em>Got someone in mind already? Head over to the ‘Recognitions’ page now and send a shout-out! Let’s spread positivity and celebrate the amazing people who make NextCorp thrive.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p>'
